## MSSData+

Following recommendations from experts in emergency management, the dataset was reorganized into three severity levels to provide more intuitive insights for governmental disaster response and resource allocation:

1 No visible damage: Posts describing the disaster without showing clear evidence of physical damage.

2 Moderate damage: Damage that can be managed or repaired by local community members without external support.

3 Severe damage: Damage requiring intervention or coordinated response from governmental or external agencies.

Reorganizing disaster severity into three categories—no visible damage, moderate damage, and severe damage—provides a clearer and more actionable framework for governmental emergency response. In real-world disaster management, decision-makers often require coarse yet operationally meaningful classifications that directly correspond to levels of intervention. The three-class schema aligns with this need by distinguishing between communities that require no assistance, those capable of self-recovery, and those that demand immediate external support. This simplification reduces ambiguity in interpreting social media reports, enhances the efficiency of resource allocation, and facilitates rapid prioritization during large-scale emergencies. Moreover, from an analytical perspective, the streamlined taxonomy improves label consistency and reduces inter-class confusion caused by subjective interpretations of intermediate damage levels. As a result, the three-class categorization not only increases the practical relevance of the dataset for emergency management agencies but also enhances the robustness and interpretability of multimodal models trained for real-world disaster assessment.
